# Compare-Mongo-SQL

This model compares the query performance time of Mongo and SQL. From a single webpage a user selects from which database (MongoDB or MySQL) they would like to execute the query, then they select the query to be executed. The time taken to execute the query is measured and displayed to the user.

I have used NodeJS to setup the server and have used HTML for the webpage designing.
